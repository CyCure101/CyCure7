        content: `
      <p>Phishing is one of the most common cyberattacks where criminals try to trick you into giving up sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. Attackers often send fake emails or messages pretending to be from trusted organizations like banks, delivery companies, or even your workplace.</p>

      <h3>How to recognize phishing:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check for spelling mistakes and poor grammar in the message.</li>
        <li>Look closely at the sender's email address â€” it might look similar but slightly different from a real one.</li>
        <li>Never click suspicious links or open attachments from unknown senders.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Always verify directly with the company through official channels if you receive unexpected requests for login or payment details.</p>

        content: `
      <p>Strong passwords are your first line of defense against hackers. Weak passwords can easily be guessed or cracked using automated tools.</p>

      <h3>Tips for creating secure passwords:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use at least 12 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
        <li>Avoid using personal information like your name, birthday, or pet's name.</li>
        <li>Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts.</li>
        <li>Consider using a password manager to generate and store your passwords securely.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security even if your password gets stolen.</p>

        content: `
      <p>Social engineering is the art of manipulating people to reveal confidential information or perform actions that compromise security.</p>

      <h3>Common social engineering tactics:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> The attacker pretends to be someone in authority to obtain sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> Offering something attractive (like free software) to trick users into downloading malware.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailgating:</strong> Following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper credentials.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Always verify the identity of anyone requesting private information and stay alert to emotional manipulation or urgent requests.</p>
